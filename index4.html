    <h3>Leagues:</h3>
    <p>A bowling league is a group of bowlers who compete regularly as teams over a set period, 
        usually weekly or biweekly. Leagues can be casual or competitive and are often organized by skill level, age group, or even themes 
        (like mixed-gender or senior leagues). Most leagues have a season format, where teams earn points based on match results, leading to playoffs or a championship. 
        Participants often enjoy both the competitive side and the social atmosphere, making leagues a fun way to improve skills and meet new people. League play typically includes set rules, 
        handicaps for balancing skill levels, and sometimes prizes or trophies.</p>

      <h3>How To Find:</h3>
      <p>Leagues are not to hard to find. There are many great websites to find leagues 
        in your area like <a href="https://www.leaguesecretary.com/bowling-centers/search"><em>League Secretary</em></a> which I personally use but 
        most bowling allies will have flyers about upcomeing leagues at that center.

      <h3>More Info:</h3>
      <p>Bowling Leagues are what making bowling what it is in my opinion.
        There is nothing that beats bowling agaisnt other individuals for either fun,
        money, or prizes. It's so much fun to hype each other up for getting a
        strike and it's even more fun to help new bowlers and give them tips on what to 
        do better.
