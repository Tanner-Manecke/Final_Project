    <h3>Starter:</h3>
    <p>It's as simple as finding a bolwing ally near you and just going to play.
        Each bolwing ally will have it's own rules but the main thing is to just rent a 
        lane for an hour or even by game, then find a ball that you like that fits your
        hand, put on some shoes and then just throw the ball at the pins.

        equipment like shoes and bowling balls. There is big benift from getting your own stuff
        like building the consistency with the same ball and shoes. Bowling becomes a huge
        game of consistency and with your own equipment you will get better in no time at.

      </p>
        <p>Now there are some drawbacks to owning your own equipment like the price you have 
            to pay to first get which could steep for some people but the bext invesment is shoes 
            because you won't be paying the rental fee when you go bolwing. You will also have to take 
            care of your own equipment to make sure it doesn't get ruined or even break.
