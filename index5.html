    <h3>What the future of bowling looks like:</h3>
    <p>I see bowling as a sport that can grow pretty big because of how easy it is 
        to try and how inclusive it is as well. It is also a sport that people can 
        make moeny from.

      <h3>Inclusivity:</h3>
      <p>Bowling is a highly inclusive sport that welcomes people of all ages, skill levels, 
        and physical abilities. Many bowling centers offer adaptive equipment—like ramps and 
        bumpers—for those with disabilities, and there are leagues and events tailored for kids, seniors, 
        and individuals with special needs. Its social, low-impact nature makes it accessible and enjoyable for a wide range of participants, 
        promoting a strong sense of community and belonging.</p>

      <h3>Careers:</h3>
      <p>The main way that people make money bowling is something called the
        PBA, Pro Bowlers Association, this is a tour similiar to the PGA were the
        best bowlers go around the country and compete for cash prizes. That's not 
        the only way to make money in bowling you can also win local tournaments or get 
        money from playing in Leagues.
